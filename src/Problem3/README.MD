# Troubleshooting Steps for High Memory Usage on NGINX Load Balancer VM
## Step: Initial Diagnosis
### Check Memory Usage:

- Run free -m to check the memory usage.
- Use top or htop to see which processes are consuming the most memory.

### Check NGINX Status:

- Run systemctl status nginx to ensure NGINX is running properly.
- Check NGINX logs for any errors or warnings: tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log.

### Check System Logs:

- Review system logs for any unusual activity: tail -f /var/log/syslog.

## Possible Causes and Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Memory Leak in NGINX
#### Cause: A memory leak in NGINX or one of its modules could cause it to consume excessive memory over time.
#### Impact: High memory usage can lead to degraded performance or even cause the VM to become unresponsive.
#### Recovery Steps:
- Restart NGINX: Temporarily alleviate the issue by restarting NGINX: sudo systemctl restart nginx.
- Update NGINX: Ensure you are running the latest version of NGINX, as updates may contain bug fixes: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade nginx.
- Check Configuration: Review NGINX configuration files for any misconfigurations that could lead to memory leaks.
- Monitor: Continue to monitor memory usage to see if the issue reoccurs.

### Scenario 2: High Traffic Load
#### Cause: An unexpected spike in traffic could cause NGINX to use more memory to handle the increased number of connections.
#### Impact: High memory usage can lead to slow response times and potential downtime if the VM runs out of memory.
#### Recovery Steps:
- Scale Up/Out: Consider scaling up the VM (increasing memory) or scaling out by adding more VMs to distribute the load.
- Optimize NGINX Configuration: Adjust NGINX settings to better handle high traffic, such as increasing worker processes and connections.
- Implement Caching: Use caching mechanisms to reduce the load on NGINX.
- Load Balancer: Consider using a more robust load balancing solution, such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), to handle traffic spikes.
